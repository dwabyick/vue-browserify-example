# Vue.js example setup with Browserify

(This example has been modified to show a challenge instantiating vue components that are dynamically inserted.)


This example inlines the CSS and HTML template of each component using the `partialify` transform, and inserts the CSS with the `insert-css` module.

To start watch and auto rebuild with `watchify`, just run `npm run dev`.
